The tiered system categorizes the tests into three tiers based on their effectiveness, patient popularity, cost-effectiveness, and other factors. The tier 1 tests, which include colonoscopy every 10 years and annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT), are recommended as first-tier options for screening average-risk individuals for colorectal neoplasia. These tests are considered to be optimal in terms of effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and patient acceptance.\n\nThe advantages of this tiered system include the ability to offer modalities with proven effectiveness and popularity with patients, a simplified discussion between physicians and patients, and the flexibility to offer other tests in a sequential fashion if patients decline the tier 1 tests. Additionally, the tiered system allows for risk-stratified approaches, such as offering colonoscopy first to certain age groups and then offering FIT to others. This approach also takes into account factors such as patient preferences, reimbursement availability, and the availability of the tests. Overall, the tiered system provides a structured and practical framework for recommending and offering colorectal cancer screening tests.", "0356c74d-d9bc-4f84-a342-2ffa3f1af661": "The first-tier options for screening average-risk persons for colorectal neoplasia, according to the recommendations of the Multi-Society Task Force, are colonoscopy every 10 years and annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
