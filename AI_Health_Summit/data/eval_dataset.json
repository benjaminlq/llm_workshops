Patients who value the highest level of sensitivity in detection of precancerous lesions and are willing to undergo invasive screening should consider choosing colonoscopy.\n\nHowever, there are also disadvantages to colonoscopy.

Operator dependence in performance is also a major disadvantage, as it affects the detection of cancer, adenomas, and serrated lesions, as well as the selection of appropriate screening and surveillance intervals after colonoscopy, and effective resection of colorectal polyps.\n\nThese factors impact the effectiveness of colonoscopy in preventing incident CRC and cancer deaths by influencing its overall risk-benefit profile. While colonoscopy has been shown to be effective in preventing incident CRC and cancer deaths, the risks associated with the procedure, as well as the operator dependence in performance, can impact its overall effectiveness.
